Hello there! I am a graduate student at [Technical University of Berlin](https://www.tu.berlin/en/) majoring in Autonomous Systems. I have a bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from [IIT Mandi](https://www.iitmandi.ac.in/) and also did a semester exchange program at [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/en/).

Currently, I am working with [Adrian Sieler](https://www.robotics.tu-berlin.de/menue/team/adrian_sieler/) and [Prof. Oliver Brock](https://www.robotics.tu-berlin.de/menue/team/oliver_brock/) on Investigating Extrinsic Dexterity of RBO hand 3. In the past, I have worked on exciting robotics projects including autonomous driving. 

I am a big fan of working out, yoga, cricket and chess. Feel free to challenge me or connect at [chess.com](https://www.chess.com/member/rocketsumit). I also love to travel and cook in my free time.
